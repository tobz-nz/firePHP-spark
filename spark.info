The console library is a implemenation of the firephp class (http://www.firephp.org).
It allows you to send log message from the server that display in the firebug console (when the firephp plugin is installed)

### Usage

	// console_log($type, $message, $write_to_file);
	console_log('log', 'This is my log message', true);

Supported log types are:

- log
- info
- warn
- error

There do seem to be limitations with how big the objects/arrays that you log out are - of your page is not refreshing properly, thats probably the problem.
